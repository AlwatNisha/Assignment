(8) What is the significance of “%” and “_” operators in the LIKE statement? 
    "%" means it Matches zero or more characters and Useful when you're not sure how many characters will appear in a certain position.
    "_" means it Matches exactly one character and  Useful when you want to match a specific character count or position.



(9) Explain normalization in the context of databases. 
    Normalization in the context of databases is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. 
    It involves dividing large tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships between them using primary and foreign keys.
    Objectives of Normalization:
				1.Eliminate redundant (duplicate) data
				2.Ensure data dependencies make sense (data is stored logically)
                3.Make the database more efficient for updates and queries
	Benefits of Normalization:
			    1.Avoids anomalies in insert, update, and delete operations
				2.Saves storage space
                3.Improves data consistency and accuracy



(10) What does a join in MySQL mean? 
       A JOIN in MySQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them.
       Purpose of JOIN:
                      To retrieve related data stored across multiple tables in a single query result.
     there are     types of join:
     1.INNER JOIN
     Returns only matching rows from both tables.
     2.LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN)
     Returns all rows from the left table, and matched rows from the right table.
     If there's no match, NULLs are shown for the right table's columns.
     3. RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN)
     Opposite of LEFT JOIN: returns all rows from the right table, matched with the left.
     4. FULL JOIN (Not supported natively in MySQL)
     Combines LEFT and RIGHT JOIN results.



(11)What do you understand about DDL, DCL, and DML in MySQL? 
      1. DDL – Data Definition Language
			DDL commands are used to define and modify the structure of database objects like tables, schemas, and indexes.
      Common DDL Commands:
			CREATE – Creates new tables or databases
            ALTER – Modifies the structure of a table
		    DROP – Deletes tables or databases
            TRUNCATE – Removes all records from a table quickly (but keeps the structure)
            RENAME – Renames a table
	 2. DML – Data Manipulation Language
             DML commands are used to work with the data stored in tables (insert, retrieve, update, or delete).
	 Common DML Commands:
			SELECT – Retrieves data
            INSERT – Adds new data
            UPDATE – Modifies existing data
            DELETE – Removes data
	3. DCL – Data Control Language
		   DCL commands are used to control access and permissions in the database.
    Common DCL Commands:
			GRANT – Gives a user permission
            REVOKE – Removes a user’s permission




(12)What is the role of the MySQL JOIN clause in a query, and what are some
common types of joins? 
The JOIN clause in MySQL is used to combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column between them. It helps in retrieving related data that is stored in separate tables — a key feature of relational databases.
use of joins:
           To avoid data duplication by splitting data into related tables
		   To fetch meaningful combined information from multiple tables
           To maintain normalized database structure while still accessing full data
Common Types of JOINs in MySQL:
  1. INNER JOIN
  2.left join
  3.right join
  4.full joIn
